   - Write developer guides
   - Document API endpoints and usage

3. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure production environment
   - Implement monitoring and logging

## Implementation Approach

### For Each Component:
1. Start with backend services and database operations
2. Create UI components with proper loading/error states
3. Implement unit tests alongside development
4. Document the component and its usage

### Development Principles:
1. Follow the established TypeScript patterns
2. Maintain strict type safety throughout the codebase
3. Use Zod schemas for data validation
4. Ensure proper error handling at all levels
5. Maintain clean, testable code with separation of concerns
6. Document security considerations for each component

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Database Schema Implementation**
   - Set up local Supabase instance for development
   - Create migration files for core tables
   - Implement and test RLS policies

2. **Property Management Implementation**
   - Create property services
   - Build property UI components
   - Implement property-user relationships

3. **Begin Appraisal Form Implementation**
   - Design appraisal creation flow
   - Create multi-step wizard components
   - Implement data validation and storage

By following this implementation plan, we'll build upon our authentication foundation to create a complete, secure, and feature-rich property appraisal platform.
