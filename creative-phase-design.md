# AppraisalHub: Complex Component Design Options

## Component Overview

This document explores design options for the complex components identified in the AppraisalHub project. For each component, we'll present multiple design approaches, evaluate their pros and cons, and recommend the most suitable option.

## 1. AI Prompt Engineering

### Component Description
The AI Prompt Engineering component is responsible for generating effective prompts for the Google Vertex AI/Gemini to produce high-quality property analysis content. This includes market analysis, property descriptions, and commentary on comparable properties.

### Requirements & Constraints
- Must generate consistent, high-quality prompts
- Should adapt to different property types and details
- Must work within token limits of the AI model
- Should handle various levels of input data completeness
- Must be testable and maintainable

### Design Options

#### Option 1: Template-Based Approach
Use predefined templates with variable substitution for different property attributes.

```typescript
// Template-based prompt generation
function generateMarketAnalysisPrompt(property: Property): string {
  return `
    Analyze the real estate market for ${property.suburb}, ${property.city}, New Zealand.
    Focus on properties of type: ${property.propertyType}.
    Include trends for properties with ${property.bedrooms} bedrooms and ${property.bathrooms} bathrooms.
    Address recent sales within ${property.landSize ? '± 20% of ' + property.landSize + ' sqm land size' : 'similar sized properties'}.
    Discuss market dynamics over the past 6 months including median price changes, time on market, and sale to list price ratios.
  `;
}
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement and understand
- Consistent structure across similar properties
- Easy to update or modify templates

**Cons:**
- Less dynamic adaptation to unique property features
- May feel repetitive across different properties
- Could miss important nuances based on property specifics

#### Option 2: Modular Prompt Construction
Build prompts by combining different modules based on available property data and specific requirements.

```typescript
// Modular prompt construction
function generateMarketAnalysisPrompt(property: Property): string {
  const promptParts: string[] = [
    getBaseMarketContext(property.suburb, property.city),
    property.propertyType ? getPropertyTypeModule(property.propertyType) : '',
    property.bedrooms && property.bathrooms ? getRoomConfigurationModule(property.bedrooms, property.bathrooms) : '',
    property.landSize ? getLandSizeModule(property.landSize) : '',
    getTimeframeModule(6), // 6 months
    getClosingInstructions()
  ];
  
  return promptParts.filter(part => part.trim() !== '').join('\n\n');
}
```

function generateMarketAnalysisPrompt(property: Property, marketData: MarketData): string {
  // Analyze property data and market context
  const significantFactors = analyzeSignificantFactors(property, marketData);
  const marketTrends = identifyRelevantMarketTrends(property, marketData);
  
  // Construct prompt emphasizing significant aspects
  const promptBase = getBasePrompt(property);
  const factorPrompts = significantFactors.map(factor => getFactorPrompt(factor));
  const trendPrompts = marketTrends.map(trend => getTrendPrompt(trend));
  
  return [
    promptBase,
    ...factorPrompts,
    ...trendPrompts,
    getClosingInstructions()
  ].join('\n\n');
}
