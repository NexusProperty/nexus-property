# AppraisalHub Implementation Plan

## References

- **Creative Design Document**: [creative-phase-design.md](./creative-phase-design.md) - Contains detailed design options, analysis, and implementation guidelines for complex components:
  - Valuation Algorithm Design
  - AI Integration Architecture
  - Report Generation UI/UX
  - Real-Time Updates with Supabase Realtime
  - Notifications System

## Implementation Priorities

### 1. Valuation Algorithm Edge Function
Implement the hybrid valuation algorithm in a Supabase Edge Function that:
- Uses weighted average calculation based on comparable properties
- Applies property-specific adjustments
- Calculates confidence score
- Handles outlier detection
- Generates final valuation range

### 2. AI Integration with Asynchronous Processing
Build an asynchronous AI integration architecture that:
- Uses Edge Functions for securely communicating with Google Vertex AI
- Implements queue management for processing requests
- Provides dynamic prompt engineering
- Stores and versions AI-generated content
- Implements real-time status updates

### 3. Report Generation with Hybrid UI Approach
Create a report generation system that:
- Offers both quick generation with presets and advanced customization
- Uses a modular template system for different property types
- Implements PDF generation in an Edge Function
- Tracks report generation progress
- Manages report storage and sharing

### 4. Real-Time Updates and Notifications
Develop a comprehensive real-time update system that:
- Uses Supabase Realtime for critical status updates
- Implements polling fallback for reliability
- Creates a progressive notification system
- Supports both in-app and email notifications
- Respects user notification preferences

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

1. **Edge Functions Architecture**
   - Implement proper error handling and retries
   - Use structured JSON logging
   - Apply consistent security practices
   - Optimize for performance within Edge Function limits

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Create reusable hooks for real-time updates
   - Implement intuitive loading and error states
   - Design consistent UI patterns for status indicators
   - Build accessible UI components

3. **Database Design**
   - Add notification and preferences tables
   - Implement proper RLS policies
   - Use optimal indexing strategies
   - Design efficient query patterns

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test core algorithm components
   - Test Edge Functions with mocked dependencies
   - Implement integration tests for critical flows
   - Verify real-time functionality with end-to-end tests
