# AppraisalHub: Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is now focused on **Core UI Components Development** after successfully completing the database schema design.

## Task Description
Develop the core UI components for the AppraisalHub application, including form components, data display components, and interactive elements that will be used throughout the application.

## Objectives
1. Create reusable form components with proper validation
2. Implement layout components for consistent UI
3. Build data visualization components for property appraisals
4. Develop interactive elements for user engagement
