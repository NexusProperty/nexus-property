# AppraisalHub: Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on **Database Schema Design & Migration Implementation**.

## Task Description
Implement the core database schema for the AppraisalHub application using Supabase migrations. This includes creating tables for profiles, teams, team_members, appraisals, and comparable properties, as well as implementing Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure proper data access control.

## Objectives
1. Set up Supabase migrations workflow
2. Create migration files for core tables with proper relationships
3. Implement RLS policies for all tables
4. Create pgTAP tests to verify RLS policy effectiveness
5. Generate TypeScript types from the database schema

- [RLS Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security)
- [pgTAP Testing Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgtap)

## References
- See the [development plan](./development-plan.md) for detailed implementation strategy
- Review the [reflection document](./reflection.md) for lessons learned from previous implementation
- Follow the [tasks.md](./tasks.md) for task tracking

## Progress
- Previous task (Technical Implementation Validation & Reflection) has been completed and archived
- Current task is part of Phase 1: Foundation & Project Setup
- Database schema design is a critical foundation for subsequent development phases

## Next Steps
1. Initialize local Supabase project
2. Create migration files for core tables
3. Implement and test RLS policies
4. Update TypeScript types based on the schema
