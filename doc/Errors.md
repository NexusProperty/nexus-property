1. Hardcoded Supabase Credentials:
The Supabase URL and API key are hardcoded in src/integrations/supabase/client.ts instead of using environment variables.
This is a security risk as these credentials are now exposed in the codebase.

2.Inconsistent Supabase Client Usage:
There are two different Supabase client implementations:
One in src/lib/supabase.ts that uses environment variables
Another in src/integrations/supabase/client.ts with hardcoded credentials
This inconsistency could lead to confusion and potential issues.

3.Missing Environment Variables:
The .env file is missing from the repository, which is needed for the Supabase client in src/lib/supabase.ts.
The .gitignore file doesn't explicitly ignore .env files, which is a best practice.

4.TypeScript Configuration Issues:
The TypeScript configuration has several flags set to false that are typically recommended to be true for better type safety:
noImplicitAny: false
strictNullChecks: false
noUnusedLocals: false
noUnusedParameters: false
These settings could lead to potential runtime errors that TypeScript could catch during development.

5.ESLint Configuration:
The ESLint configuration has @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars turned off, which could lead to unused variables in the codebase.

6.Supabase Edge Functions:
The Supabase Edge Functions are using Deno, but there's no clear documentation on how to deploy or test these functions locally.

7.Error Handling:
The error handling in aiIntegrationService.ts is basic and could be improved to provide more specific error messages.

8.Code Organization:
The codebase has a mix of different directory structures and naming conventions, which could make it harder to maintain.

9.Security:
The hardcoded Supabase credentials in the codebase are a significant security risk, especially if this code is pushed to a public repository.

10.Dependency Management:
The project has both package-lock.json and bun.lockb files, which suggests a mix of package managers (npm and bun). This could lead to inconsistencies in dependency management.

11.API Integration:
The AI integration service is making calls to a Supabase Edge Function, but there's no clear error handling or retry mechanism for network failures.
