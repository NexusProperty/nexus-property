# AppraisalHub: Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
AppraisalHub is an AI-powered property appraisal platform for the New Zealand real estate market. The platform enables real estate agents to quickly generate property valuations with detailed market analysis using AI and data from external property sources.

## Target Users
- **Real Estate Agents**: Primary users who need to generate property appraisals
- **Property Owners**: Secondary users who can view appraisals of their properties
- **Administrators**: Platform managers who oversee users and system operations

## Objectives
1. Create a responsive, user-friendly web application for property appraisals
2. Implement secure authentication and role-based access
3. Integrate with Supabase for database, auth, and storage
4. Implement AI-powered property analysis and report generation
5. Build administrative features for platform management

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **External Services**: Google Vertex AI/Gemini, Property Data APIs

## Definition of Done (DoD)
A task is considered done when all of the following criteria are met:
1. Code is complete and has been reviewed
2. All required tests (unit, integration, E2E if applicable) are written and passing
3. Accessibility checks (automated & manual) have passed
4. Documentation has been updated (code comments, README, ADRs, guides as needed)
5. For backend: Database migrations have been created via the proper workflow and tested
6. For backend: RLS policies have been implemented and tested via pgTAP
7. Deployed to staging environment and verified (if applicable)

- No actual Supabase integration yet
- Planning documentation available

## Next Steps
1. Complete Supabase project setup and configuration
2. Implement database schema and migrations
3. Set up RLS policies and test them
4. Create the canonical Supabase client for frontend integration
5. Implement authentication with Supabase Auth

## Complexity Assessment
**Level: 3 - Medium to High Complexity**

The project involves multiple user roles, complex data flows, AI integration, and comprehensive security requirements. It requires expertise in React, TypeScript, Supabase, and potentially AI services integration. The implementation follows a strict migration-driven workflow for database changes and relies heavily on RLS for security.
