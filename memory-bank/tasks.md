# CoreLogic API Integration Task

## Summary
We need to integrate the CoreLogic NZ API to provide accurate property data, valuations, and market insights for our automated appraisal system. This will replace the current mock implementations with real data from CoreLogic, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of our property appraisals.

## Current Focus
- [ ] Setup CoreLogic API Integration
  - [ ] Create CoreLogic API client with authentication
  - [ ] Implement API endpoints for property data
  - [ ] Develop data transformation layer
  - [ ] Update Edge Functions to use CoreLogic data
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling

## Implementation Steps
1. Create CoreLogic service module structure
2. Implement core API methods for property data
3. Develop data transformation functions
4. Create mock implementation for development
5. Update existing Edge Functions
6. Implement sandbox integration
7. Comprehensive testing
8. Performance optimization
9. Production deployment

## Files Created
- [x] Implementation plan: [CoreLogic-API/implementation-plan.md](./CoreLogic-API/implementation-plan.md)
- [x] Task breakdown: [CoreLogic-API/tasks.md](./CoreLogic-API/tasks.md)
- [x] Type definitions: [CoreLogic-API/corelogic-types.ts](./CoreLogic-API/corelogic-types.ts)
- [x] API service: [CoreLogic-API/corelogic-service.ts](./CoreLogic-API/corelogic-service.ts)
- [x] Mock implementation: [CoreLogic-API/corelogic-mock.ts](./CoreLogic-API/corelogic-mock.ts)
- [x] Data transformers: [CoreLogic-API/corelogic-transformers.ts](./CoreLogic-API/corelogic-transformers.ts)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Request CoreLogic API sandbox credentials
- [ ] Set up development environment for CoreLogic integration
- [ ] Begin implementation of API client
- [ ] Create and run unit tests for the implementation

# Testing Task Implementation Progress

## Summary
The implementation of utility, data transformation, security tests, Edge Function tests, and third-party API integration tests is now complete. The security test suite covers authentication rate limiting, password policies, session management, role-based access control, Row Level Security policies, API access controls, and input validation. Edge Function tests provide comprehensive testing for property data, property valuation, AI market analysis, and report generation functions. Third-party API integration tests now cover CoreLogic NZ, REINZ data, and Gemini AI integrations. The details of the implementation have been documented in the [Testing Implementation Summary](./Testing/implementation-summary.md).
