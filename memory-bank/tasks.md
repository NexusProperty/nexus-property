# Active Tasks

## Current Task: Memory Bank Implementation

### Status: In Progress

### Checklist
- [x] Initialize Memory Bank structure
- [ ] Create core Memory Bank files
  - [ ] tasks.md (this file)
  - [ ] activeContext.md
  - [ ] progress.md
  - [ ] projectbrief.md
  - [ ] productContext.md
  - [ ] systemPatterns.md
  - [ ] techContext.md
  - [ ] style-guide.md
- [ ] Setup Creative Phase directory
- [ ] Setup Reflection directory
- [ ] Setup Archive directory
- [ ] Document Memory Bank usage guidelines

### Implementation Steps
1. Create all core files in the memory-bank directory
2. Define project context in relevant files
3. Document system patterns and technical architecture
4. Create style guide for consistent implementation
5. Document progress tracking methodology
6. Setup directories for creative phase, reflection, and archive

### Notes
- Memory Bank will provide centralized documentation and task tracking
- All files will reside within the memory-bank directory
- System will support creative phase documentation, reflection, and archiving

# Testing Task Implementation Progress

## Summary
The implementation of utility, data transformation, and security tests is now complete. The security test suite covers authentication rate limiting, password policies, session management, role-based access control, Row Level Security policies, API access controls, and input validation. The details of the implementation have been documented in the [Testing Implementation Summary](./Testing/implementation-summary.md).

## Current Focus
- [x] Implement Utility Tests and Data Transformation Tests
- [x] Implement Security Tests
  - [x] Authentication rate limiting tests
  - [x] Password policy validation tests
  - [x] Session security and management tests
  - [x] Row Level Security policy tests
  - [x] Role-based access restriction tests
  - [x] API access control tests
  - [x] Input validation security tests
  - [x] SQL injection protection tests
- [ ] Implement Edge Function Tests
  - [ ] Property data function tests
  - [ ] Property valuation function tests
  - [ ] AI market analysis function tests
  - [ ] Report generation function tests

- [x] Create tests for data transformation logic
- [x] Implement security testing
  - [x] Created authentication security tests (auth-security.test.ts)
  - [x] Created session management tests (session-security.test.ts)
  - [x] Implemented Row Level Security policy tests (rls-policy.test.ts)
  - [x] Created role-based access control tests (role-access.test.ts)
