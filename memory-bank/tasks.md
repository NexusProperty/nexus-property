# Nexus Property - Project Tasks

## ESLint & TypeScript Type Issues Fix

**Date Started**: 2025-05-17
**Task Type**: Code Quality Improvement
**Priority**: Medium
**Complexity**: Medium

### Task Description
Fix TypeScript 'any' type issues identified by ESLint in the codebase. The ESLint rule `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is being enforced despite `noImplicitAny: false` in tsconfig, causing errors in the linting process.

### Approach
1. Replace explicit `any` types with more specific type definitions
2. Use appropriate type annotations based on context
3. When an exact type is unknown but can be narrowed:
   - Use the `unknown` type and apply type guards
   - Define appropriate interfaces or type aliases
   - Use generics where appropriate

### Progress Tracking

| File | Lines | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
