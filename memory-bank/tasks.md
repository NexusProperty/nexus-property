# Active Tasks

## Current Task: Memory Bank Implementation

### Status: In Progress

### Checklist
- [x] Initialize Memory Bank structure
- [ ] Create core Memory Bank files
  - [ ] tasks.md (this file)
  - [ ] activeContext.md
  - [ ] progress.md
  - [ ] projectbrief.md
  - [ ] productContext.md
  - [ ] systemPatterns.md
  - [ ] techContext.md
  - [ ] style-guide.md
- [ ] Setup Creative Phase directory
- [ ] Setup Reflection directory
- [ ] Setup Archive directory
- [ ] Document Memory Bank usage guidelines

### Implementation Steps
1. Create all core files in the memory-bank directory
2. Define project context in relevant files
3. Document system patterns and technical architecture
4. Create style guide for consistent implementation
5. Document progress tracking methodology
6. Setup directories for creative phase, reflection, and archive

### Notes
- Memory Bank will provide centralized documentation and task tracking
- All files will reside within the memory-bank directory
- System will support creative phase documentation, reflection, and archiving

# Testing Task Implementation Progress

## Summary
The implementation of utility, data transformation, security tests, Edge Function tests, and third-party API integration tests is now complete. The security test suite covers authentication rate limiting, password policies, session management, role-based access control, Row Level Security policies, API access controls, and input validation. Edge Function tests provide comprehensive testing for property data, property valuation, AI market analysis, and report generation functions. Third-party API integration tests now cover CoreLogic NZ, REINZ data, and Gemini AI integrations. The details of the implementation have been documented in the [Testing Implementation Summary](./Testing/implementation-summary.md).
