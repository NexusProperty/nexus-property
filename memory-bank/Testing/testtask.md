# AppraisalHub Testing Task Plan

This document outlines the specific testing tasks required to build a comprehensive testing framework for the AppraisalHub platform, based on the testing roadmap.

## Task Overview

The goal is to implement a structured testing framework that ensures quality, reliability, and security across all features of the AppraisalHub platform. This task focuses on implementing the necessary testing infrastructure and initial test suites.

   - Row Level Security (RLS) validation
   
2. **Core Business Logic**
   - Property data integration
   - Appraisal generation
   - Valuation algorithm accuracy
   
3. **Supabase Integration**
   - Database interactions
   - Edge Functions
   - Realtime updates

4. **Critical User Flows**
   - Appraisal creation process
   - Property management
   - Report generation

## Testing Tools & Technologies

The following tools have been implemented for the testing infrastructure:

- [x] **Component Testing Library**: React Testing Library
- [x] **E2E Testing**: Playwright
- [ ] **API Testing**: Supertest or similar
- [ ] **Database Testing**: pgTAP for Postgres/Supabase
- [ ] **Mocking Library**: MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- [x] **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions

## Test Data Strategy

- [x] Create test mocks for Supabase responses
- [ ] Create a set of fixed test data for predictable tests
- [ ] Implement dynamic test data generation for edge cases
- [ ] Use isolated test database with seeding and cleanup
- [ ] Mock external API responses for consistent testing

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach where appropriate
2. Prioritize tests for critical business logic
3. Ensure test coverage for both happy paths and error conditions
4. Document test setup and data requirements
5. Keep tests maintainable with proper abstraction and utilities
6. Ensure tests run efficiently in CI pipeline
