# AppraisalHub Testing Task Plan

This document outlines the specific testing tasks required to build a comprehensive testing framework for the AppraisalHub platform, based on the testing roadmap.

## Task Overview

The goal is to implement a structured testing framework that ensures quality, reliability, and security across all features of the AppraisalHub platform. This task focuses on implementing the necessary testing infrastructure and initial test suites.

## Priority Testing Areas

Based on the current implementation status and complexity, the following areas should be prioritized:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - User login/registration flows
   - Role-based access control
   - Row Level Security (RLS) validation
   
2. **Core Business Logic**
   - Property data integration
   - Appraisal generation
   - Valuation algorithm accuracy
   
3. **Supabase Integration**
   - Database interactions
   - Edge Functions
   - Realtime updates

4. **Critical User Flows**
   - Appraisal creation process
   - Property management
   - Report generation

## Testing Tools & Technologies

The following tools have been implemented for the testing infrastructure:

- [x] **Unit & Component Testing**: Vitest with jsdom
- [x] **Component Testing Library**: React Testing Library
- [x] **E2E Testing**: Playwright
- [ ] **API Testing**: Supertest or similar
- [ ] **Database Testing**: pgTAP for Postgres/Supabase
- [ ] **Mocking Library**: MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- [x] **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions

## Test Data Strategy

- [x] Create test mocks for Supabase responses
- [ ] Create a set of fixed test data for predictable tests
- [ ] Implement dynamic test data generation for edge cases
- [ ] Use isolated test database with seeding and cleanup
- [ ] Mock external API responses for consistent testing

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach where appropriate
2. Prioritize tests for critical business logic
3. Ensure test coverage for both happy paths and error conditions
4. Document test setup and data requirements
5. Keep tests maintainable with proper abstraction and utilities
6. Ensure tests run efficiently in CI pipeline

## Implementation Notes

- Created basic component testing infrastructure with Vitest and React Testing Library
- Implemented auth service tests with proper mocking of Supabase
- Created AuthContext integration tests to ensure proper context behavior
- Implemented E2E test infrastructure with Playwright
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Added utilities for Supabase mocking (createMockSupabaseClient, createMockUser, etc.)
- There are still some issues with the integration tests that need to be addressed
- Documentation has been added to help future developers understand the testing approach

## Next Steps

1. Fix the failing integration tests
2. Complete more component tests for critical UI components
3. Implement tests for more services beyond auth
4. Develop Edge Function integration tests
5. Create E2E tests for critical user flows
6. Configure a test database for more comprehensive integration testing
