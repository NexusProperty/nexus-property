# AppraisalHub: Creative Design Exploration

## Component Design Exploration

This document explores design options for upcoming components and features in the AppraisalHub platform. It presents multiple approaches for each component, analyzes their pros and cons, and provides recommended implementation guidelines.

---

## 1. Valuation Algorithm Design

### Component Description
The valuation algorithm is a critical component of the AppraisalHub platform that calculates property valuations based on comparable properties and market data. It needs to be accurate, transparent, and adaptable to different property types and market conditions.

### Requirements & Constraints
- Must generate a valuation range (low-high estimates) with confidence score
- Should consider comparable properties' similarity, recency, and location
- Must account for property-specific features (bedrooms, bathrooms, land size, etc.)
- Should provide explainable results that can be presented to users
- Must execute efficiently within an Edge Function (<10s execution time)
- Should handle edge cases gracefully (limited comparables, outliers, etc.)

### Design Options

#### Option 1: Rule-Based Weighted Average
A deterministic approach that applies configurable weights to comparable properties based on similarity score, recency, and distance.

**Pros:**
- Highly explainable and transparent
- Straightforward implementation 
- Easy to tune with domain knowledge
- Handles edge cases gracefully

**Cons:**
- May oversimplify complex market relationships
- Requires manual tuning of weight parameters
- Limited ability to adapt to changing market conditions
- May not handle novel property configurations well

#### Option 2: Statistical Regression Model
A multi-variable regression approach that models property value based on key features and market indicators.

**Pros:**
- Data-driven approach with statistical validity
- Can capture complex relationships between variables
- Provides confidence intervals naturally
- Better adaptability to different markets

**Cons:**
- Requires significant training data for accuracy
- More complex to implement within Edge Function constraints
- Less explainable to non-technical users
- May struggle with limited data scenarios

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach with Adjustable Confidence
A combination approach that uses weighted comparables as the primary method but incorporates statistical methods for confidence scoring and outlier detection.

**Pros:**
- Balances simplicity with statistical rigor
- More explainable than pure statistical models
- Handles edge cases better than pure rule-based approaches
- Provides realistic confidence scores
- Adaptable to different property types

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation than pure rule-based approach
- Requires careful integration of multiple methods
- May still require some manual tuning

### Recommended Approach
**Option 3: Hybrid Approach with Adjustable Confidence**

This balanced approach leverages the explainability of rule-based methods while incorporating statistical techniques for improved accuracy and confidence estimation. It's well-suited to the constraints of Edge Functions while providing robust valuations.

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Implement core weighted average calculation based on:
   - Similarity score (40% weight)
   - Recency of sale (30% weight)
   - Distance/location proximity (30% weight)

2. Apply property-specific adjustments:
   - Per-bedroom value adjustment based on local averages
   - Land size premium/discount based on suburb norms
   - Condition/quality score modifier

3. Calculate confidence score using:
   - Number of available comparables (more = higher confidence)
   - Standard deviation of adjusted comparable prices
   - Range of similarity scores (more similar = higher confidence)
   - Data recency (more recent sales = higher confidence)

4. Implement outlier detection and handling:
   - Use Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify outliers
   - Apply reduced weight to outliers rather than removing entirely
   - Increase uncertainty range when outliers are present

5. Generate final valuation range:
   - Use weighted median for center point
   - Set range width based on confidence score and market volatility
   - Ensure minimum range width of Â±5% to account for inherent market uncertainty
