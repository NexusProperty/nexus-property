# Valuation Algorithm Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for enhancing the property valuation algorithm with CoreLogic and REINZ data integration. The goal is to improve the accuracy, confidence, and explainability of property valuations by leveraging advanced data sources and implementing refined statistical methods.

## Goals

1. Incorporate CoreLogic AVM (Automated Valuation Model) data into the valuation process
2. Refine outlier detection with improved statistical methods
3. Enhance price adjustment calculations to account for additional property attributes
4. Implement an improved confidence scoring system that integrates CoreLogic confidence metrics
5. Add more comprehensive market trends analysis in valuations

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: CoreLogic AVM Integration

#### Tasks:
1. **Modify the Valuation Request Structure**
   - Update ValuationRequest interface to include CoreLogic AVM data
   - Add fields for AVM estimate, range low/high, confidence score

2. **Implement Hybrid Valuation Approach**
   - Create a weighted blending of CoreLogic AVM and comparable-based valuation
   - Use CoreLogic confidence score to influence the weighting
   - Fallback to pure comparable-based valuation when AVM data is unavailable

3. **Update Final Valuation Calculation**
   - Adjust the final valuation formula to incorporate AVM data
   - Update the confidence range calculation to utilize CoreLogic range data

### Phase 2: Improved Outlier Detection

#### Tasks:
1. **Implement Advanced Statistical Methods**
   - Replace IQR method with Modified Z-score approach for better outlier detection
   - Add contextual outlier detection based on property attributes and location
   - Implement Chauvenet's criterion for statistical validation of outliers

2. **Dynamic Outlier Handling**
   - Create a graduated approach to outlier handling based on confidence metrics
   - Allow partial influence of outliers rather than complete exclusion
   - Implement weight adjustments based on distance from mean and data quality

### Phase 3: Enhanced Price Adjustment Calculations

#### Tasks:
1. **Expand Property Attribute Factors**
   - Add adjustments for additional CoreLogic attributes (architectural style, construction materials, condition, etc.)
   - Incorporate location-specific factor adjustments based on market analysis
   - Implement time-based adjustments using market trends data

2. **Market-Driven Adjustment Factors**
   - Create dynamic adjustment factors based on recent market movements
   - Develop suburb-specific adjustment factors using REINZ data
   - Implement seasonal adjustment factors based on historical patterns

3. **Machine Learning Integration (Future)**
   - Prepare framework for ML-based adjustment factors
   - Document approach for collecting training data
   - Outline validation methodology for ML predictions

### Phase 4: Improved Confidence Scoring

#### Tasks:
1. **Multi-factor Confidence Model**
   - Create a comprehensive confidence scoring algorithm that includes:
     - CoreLogic AVM confidence
     - Comparable property quality metrics
     - Data recency and relevance scores
     - Statistical consistency measures
     - Market volatility indicators

2. **Confidence Visualization**
   - Develop confidence level categories (Very High, High, Moderate, Low)
   - Create confidence breakdown for transparency
   - Implement data quality indicators for user feedback

### Phase 5: Market Trends Analysis

#### Tasks:
1. **Comprehensive Market Indicators**
   - Incorporate REINZ and CoreLogic market trend data
   - Calculate short-term (3-month) and long-term (12-month) growth rates
   - Add market strength indicators (buyer/seller market)

2. **Predictive Indicators**
   - Implement forward-looking valuation adjustments based on trend data
   - Create market momentum indicators
   - Add seasonal adjustment factors

## Technical Approach

### Core Algorithm Updates:

1. **`calculateValuation()` Function**
   ```typescript
   async function calculateValuation(request: ValuationRequest): Promise<ValuationResult> {
     // 1. Extract CoreLogic AVM data if available
     // 2. Run enhanced outlier detection
     // 3. Calculate adjusted prices with expanded factors
     // 4. Apply refined weighting system
     // 5. Blend comparable-based valuation with AVM (if available)
     // 6. Calculate improved confidence score
     // 7. Generate comprehensive market trends
     // 8. Return enhanced result
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Outlier Detection**
   ```typescript
   function detectOutliersAdvanced(
     comparables: ComparableProperty[], 
     propertyDetails: PropertyDetails
   ): { 
     gradedComparables: Array<ComparableProperty & { outlierScore: number }>, 
     outliers: ComparableProperty[] 
   } {
     // Implement Modified Z-score method
     // Apply contextual filtering
     // Return comparables with outlier scores (0-1)
   }
   ```

3. **Hybrid Valuation Calculation**
   ```typescript
   function calculateHybridValuation(
     comparableBasedValuation: { low: number; mid: number; high: number; confidence: number },
     avmValuation: { low: number; estimate: number; high: number; confidence: number } | null
   ): { low: number; mid: number; high: number; confidence: number; blend: string } {
     // Calculate blended valuation if AVM is available
     // Weight based on respective confidences
     // Return combined valuation with explanation
   }
   ```

## Expected Improvements

1. **Accuracy**: 15-20% improvement in valuation accuracy by incorporating CoreLogic AVM
2. **Confidence**: More reliable confidence scoring with clearer indication of valuation reliability
3. **Explainability**: Enhanced market analysis and factor breakdown for better user understanding
4. **Edge Cases**: Improved handling of unique properties and sparse data scenarios
5. **Market Alignment**: Better alignment with official market indicators from REINZ

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: CoreLogic AVM integration and hybrid valuation approach
- **Week 2**: Enhanced outlier detection and price adjustment calculations
- **Week 3**: Improved confidence scoring and market trends analysis
- **Week 4**: Testing, validation, and documentation

## Dependencies

1. Access to CoreLogic AVM data
2. Access to REINZ market statistics
3. Historical validation dataset for algorithm testing

## Next Steps

1. Update `property-valuation/index.ts` with AVM integration
