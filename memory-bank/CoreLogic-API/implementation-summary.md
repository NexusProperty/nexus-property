# CoreLogic API Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation status of the CoreLogic API integration for Nexus Property. The integration is designed to provide accurate property data, valuations, and market insights from CoreLogic's API.

## Current Status

- **Phase 1 (Setup & Development)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Phase 2 (Integration & Testing)**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS (7/10 days)
- **Phase 3 (Deployment & Monitoring)**: ‚è≥ PENDING (0/6 days)

## Completed Components

### Core Infrastructure

- ‚úÖ API client with authentication (`corelogic-service.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Type definitions (`corelogic-types.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Data transformation layer (`corelogic-transformers.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Mock implementation (`corelogic-mock.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Edge Function implementation (`property-data-edge-function.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Database schema for caching (`property_data_cache` table)
- ‚úÖ Feature flag infrastructure (`feature_flags` table)

### Performance and Reliability

- ‚úÖ Caching implementation with TTL
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization and request batching
- ‚úÖ Feature flag controlled rollout capability
- ‚úÖ Structured logging foundations

### Testing and Documentation

- ‚úÖ Testing framework
- ‚úÖ Mock data for development and testing
- ‚úÖ Deployment scripts and procedures
- ‚úÖ Documentation for integration and usage

## Pending Components

### Critical Path Items

- ‚è≥ CoreLogic sandbox credentials (blocker for sandbox testing)
- ‚è≥ Sandbox environment configuration and testing
- ‚è≥ Finalization of transformers based on real API responses

### Additional Components

- ‚è≥ Advanced monitoring setup (alerts, dashboards)
- ‚è≥ Circuit breaker implementation for API resilience
- ‚è≥ End-to-end testing with frontend components

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Integrated

The following CoreLogic API endpoints have been integrated:

1. **Address Matching**: `/search/nz/matcher/address`
2. **Property Attributes**: 
   - `/property-details/nz/properties/{propertyId}/attributes/core`
   - `/property-details/nz/properties/{propertyId}/attributes/additional`
3. **Sales History**: `/property-details/nz/properties/{propertyId}/sales`
4. **Automated Valuation**: `/avm/nz/properties/{propertyId}/avm/intellival/consumer/current`
5. **Market Statistics**: `/statistics/v1/statistics.json`

### Edge Function Integration

The property-data Edge Function has been updated to use the CoreLogic API client with the following features:

- Authentication and CSRF protection preserved
- Feature flag controlled activation
- Progressive rollout capabilities (percentage-based)
- Caching to improve performance and reduce API calls
- Structured logging for monitoring and troubleshooting

### Database Enhancements

Two new database tables have been created:

1. **`property_data_cache`**: Stores cached property data with TTL
2. **`feature_flags`**: Controls feature activation and rollout percentage

## Next Steps

1. **Critical**: Obtain CoreLogic sandbox credentials
2. Configure sandbox environment for testing
3. Complete monitoring infrastructure setup
4. Implement circuit breakers for API resilience
5. Conduct end-to-end testing with frontend components

## Deployment Procedure

A deployment script (`scripts/deploy-corelogic-updates.sh`) has been created to facilitate deployment of the CoreLogic integration:

1. Applies database migrations for cache and feature flags
2. Deploys the updated Edge Function
3. Configures environment variables
4. Provides guidance for feature flag activation
