# CoreLogic API Integration: Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

We have successfully completed several key components of the CoreLogic API integration:

1. **Database Infrastructure**
   - Created the `property_data_cache` table for storing API responses with TTL
   - Implemented feature flags table for controlled rollout
   - Added RLS policies for security

2. **Edge Function Update**
   - Updated the property-data Edge Function with CoreLogic API client integration
   - Preserved authentication and CSRF protection
   - Implemented feature flag checking for controlled deployment
   - Added caching mechanism with TTL support
   - Enhanced error handling with structured logging

3. **Feature Flag Implementation**
   - Created feature flags table structure
   - Implemented percentage-based rollout mechanism
   - Added feature flag checking in the Edge Function
   - Prepared for gradual enablement

4. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Created deployment script for database migrations and Edge Function updates
   - Added environment variable setup for CoreLogic API credentials
   - Prepared mock mode for development and testing

## Pending Tasks

### Critical Priority

1. **Obtain CoreLogic Sandbox Credentials**
   - Submit request to CoreLogic for sandbox API access
   - Securely store credentials in environment variables
   - Test authentication with sandbox environment

2. **Sandbox Integration**
   - Configure environment to use sandbox API
   - Run validation tests against sandbox API
   - Adjust transformers based on actual API responses
   - Verify error handling with real API errors

### High Priority

1. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Implement structured logging enhancements
   - Set up error rate and performance alerts
   - Create dashboards for API usage and performance
   - Add circuit breaker implementation for resilience

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test frontend integration with the updated Edge Function
   - Validate data flow from API through to UI
   - Verify error handling and user experience
   - Test with different feature flag settings

3. **Production Preparation**
   - Finalize cache invalidation and TTL settings
   - Configure production environment variables
   - Prepare rollout plan with feature flag stages
   - Create rollback procedures

## Implementation Timeline

| Task | Estimated Duration | Dependencies | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| Obtain CoreLogic Sandbox Credentials | 1-2 weeks | External (CoreLogic) | üîÑ In Progress |
| Sandbox Integration | 3-5 days | Sandbox Credentials | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Monitoring Setup | 3 days | None | ‚è≥ Pending |
| End-to-End Testing | 2-3 days | Sandbox Integration | ‚è≥ Pending |
| Production Preparation | 2 days | End-to-End Testing | ‚è≥ Pending |

## Action Items

1. **Immediate**
   - [x] Create database migrations for cache and feature flags
   - [x] Update property-data Edge Function with CoreLogic implementation
   - [x] Implement feature flag checking
   - [x] Create deployment script
   - [ ] Submit request for CoreLogic sandbox credentials

2. **Next**
   - [ ] Implement monitoring enhancements from monitoring-setup.md
   - [ ] Create circuit breaker implementation
   - [ ] Prepare frontend components for testing

3. **Pending Sandbox Access**
   - [ ] Configure sandbox environment
   - [ ] Validate API responses against transformers
   - [ ] Adjust implementation based on findings
   - [ ] Complete end-to-end testing

## Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Delay in obtaining sandbox credentials | High | Medium | Continue development with mock mode, prepare all other components |
| API responses differ from documentation | Medium | Medium | Built flexible transformers, prepared to adjust based on actual responses |
| Performance issues with real API | Medium | Low | Implemented caching, batch processing, and optimization strategies |
| Excessive API costs in production | High | Low | Feature flags allow gradual rollout, caching reduces API calls |

## Conclusion

We have made significant progress on the CoreLogic API integration, completing all components that can be developed without sandbox access. The critical path now depends on obtaining sandbox credentials to validate our implementation against the real API.

In the meantime, we can focus on enhancing monitoring, implementing circuit breakers for resilience, and preparing frontend components for integration testing. Once sandbox access is available, we can quickly validate and adjust our implementation, then proceed to end-to-end testing and production preparation.
