### All TypeScript 'any' Type Issues and React Hook Dependency Issues Resolved
All files with TypeScript 'any' type issues have been fixed by:
- Replacing `any` with `unknown` when the exact type is unclear
- Creating appropriate type assertions with `as Record<string, unknown>` for objects
- Using `as Array<Record<string, unknown>>` for arrays
- Using generics and type assertions to properly type API responses
- Using specific type casting for special cases like the Supabase client

All React Hook Dependency Issues have been fixed by:
- Adding missing dependencies to useEffect dependency arrays
- Using useCallback to memoize functions that are used in dependency arrays
- Replacing spread syntax in dependency arrays with Array.concat()
- Memoizing complex objects to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Fixes for React Refresh Issues (2025-05-21)
1. **src/components/ui/badge.tsx** ✅:
   - Moved `badgeVariants` to a dedicated file at `src/lib/ui-variants/badge-variants.ts`
   - Updated imports to reference the extracted variant
   - Ensured the component file only exports components

2. **src/components/ui/button.tsx** ✅:
   - Moved `buttonVariants` to a dedicated file at `src/lib/ui-variants/button-variants.ts`
   - Updated imports to reference the extracted variant
   - Ensured the component file only exports components

3. **src/components/ui/error-message.tsx** ✅:
   - Moved `ErrorCategory` enum to a dedicated file at `src/lib/enums/error-categories.ts`
   - Updated imports to reference the extracted enum
   - Ensured the component file only exports components

4. **src/components/ui/feedback-system.tsx** ✅:
   - Moved `loadingVariants` to a dedicated file at `src/lib/ui-variants/loading-variants.ts`
   - Moved toast and status message types, variants, and helper functions to `src/lib/ui-variants/feedback-variants.ts`
   - Extracted the `useFeedback` hook to a dedicated file at `src/lib/hooks/use-feedback.ts`
   - Updated imports and references
   - Ensured the component file only exports components
   
5. **src/components/ui/form-elements.tsx** ✅:
   - Moved form utility functions to a dedicated file at `src/lib/form-utils/form-utils.ts`
   - Updated imports to reference the extracted functions
   - Ensured the component file only exports components

6. **src/components/ui/form.tsx** ✅:
   - Moved form field context, item context, and hooks to `src/lib/form-utils/form-contexts.ts`
   - Updated imports to reference the extracted utilities
   - Ensured the component file only exports components

7. **src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx** ✅:
   - Moved `navigationMenuTriggerStyle` to `src/lib/ui-variants/navigation-menu-variants.ts`
   - Updated imports to reference the extracted style
   - Removed the style from exports
   - Ensured the component file only exports components

The React Refresh issues have been fixed by implementing a consistent approach of separating non-component exports from component exports:
- Variants, constants, enums, and utility functions have been moved to appropriate directories
- Created a consistent directory structure and naming convention
- Maintained type safety throughout the refactoring
- Ensured each component file only exports components

We have established the following pattern for organizing code:
1. **UI Variants**: Component styling variants are moved to `src/lib/ui-variants/` (e.g., `button-variants.ts`)
2. **Enums and Constants**: Enum definitions are moved to `src/lib/enums/` (e.g., `error-categories.ts`) 
3. **Form Utilities**: Form-related functions and contexts are moved to `src/lib/form-utils/` (e.g., `form-contexts.ts`)
4. **Custom Hooks**: Extracted hooks are moved to `src/lib/hooks/` (e.g., `use-feedback.ts`)

This approach improves code organization, enhances maintainability, and enables proper functioning of React's Fast Refresh feature, which significantly improves the developer experience by allowing component changes to be reflected without losing component state.

## Overview
This document catalogs all linter issues found in the codebase using `npm run lint`. The issues are categorized by type for easier prioritization and resolution.

## ESLint Configuration
Current settings in `eslint.config.js` and `tsconfig` files show:
- TypeScript is configured with `noImplicitAny: false` in tsconfig files
- ESLint is configured with `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars: "off"`

## Issue Categories

### 1. TypeScript 'any' Type Issues (39)
The `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` rule is being enforced despite `noImplicitAny: false` in tsconfig.

### 7. Other Issues (3)

| File | Line | Issue |
|------|------|-------|
| src/tests/security/role-access.test.ts | 14:9 | Parsing error: '>' expected |
| supabase/functions/property-data/corelogic-transformers.ts | 128:7 | 'addressParts' is never reassigned. Use 'const' |
| tailwind.config.ts | 95:12 | A require() style import is forbidden |

## Proposed Fixes

### Short-term Fixes
1. Fix the parsing error in `src/tests/security/role-access.test.ts` which is likely breaking the build.
2. Replace @ts-ignore with @ts-expect-error where needed.
3. Fix 'const' vs 'let' variable declaration in corelogic-transformers.ts.
4. Fix the require() style import in tailwind.config.ts.

### Medium-term Fixes
1. Fix React Hook dependency issues to prevent potential bugs.
2. Resolve empty interface issues.
3. Address unused ESLint disable directives.

### Long-term Fixes
1. Gradually replace `any` types with proper type definitions.
2. Refactor UI component files to separate component exports from utilities/constants.

## Configuration Recommendations and Implementation

### Changes Implemented
We've added a commented suggestion in `eslint.config.js` to provide a more gradual transition approach:

```javascript
// In eslint.config.js
rules: {
  // ...existing rules
  // "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? "error" : "warn",
}
```

### Recommended Configuration Strategy
For a systematic approach to resolving TypeScript 'any' type issues, consider:

1. **Phased Implementation**:
   - First phase: Enable the rule as a warning in development, error in production
   - Second phase: Enable as error across all environments

2. **Type-Safety Strategy**:
   - Use `unknown` as a safer alternative to `any` when specific types aren't known
   - Create proper interfaces and type definitions for complex objects
   - Implement type guards to safely narrow types when needed

3. **Implementation Command**:
   The following command can be used to apply auto-fixes when possible:
   ```bash
   npx eslint --fix path/to/file.ts
   ```

This approach would allow for a gradual transition while maintaining code quality and ensuring type safety.
