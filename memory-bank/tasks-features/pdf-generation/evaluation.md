# PDF Generation Library Evaluation

## Comparison: Puppeteer/Playwright vs pdfMake

### Puppeteer/Playwright

**Pros:**
- Currently used in the system, providing established code patterns
- Excellent HTML/CSS rendering fidelity
- Supports complex layouts and custom CSS styles
- Allows full control over page formatting
- Supports client-side charts and visualizations
- Can generate screenshots of visualizations for inclusion in reports

**Cons:**
- Requires headless Chrome which can be resource-intensive
- Slower generation time compared to pdfMake
- More complex setup in serverless environments

### pdfMake

**Pros:**
- Lightweight and optimized for serverless environments
- Faster PDF generation
- Lower memory footprint
- Declarative document definition
- Good for programmatic report generation

**Cons:**
- Limited layout capabilities compared to HTML/CSS
- Less flexible styling options
- More difficult to implement complex designs
- Would require significant rewrite of existing report templates
- Charts and visualizations need to be pre-rendered as images

## Decision

After evaluation, we have decided to continue using Puppeteer for the following reasons:

1. **Existing Implementation**: We already have a working Puppeteer setup in our Edge Functions.
2. **Design Requirements**: The enhanced report designs require advanced styling capabilities.
3. **Brand Integration**: HTML/CSS provides more flexibility for implementing agency branding.
4. **Data Visualization**: The enhanced reports need interactive or complex visualizations best rendered in HTML.

We will optimize the existing Puppeteer implementation by:
1. Ensuring efficient resource usage in the Edge Function environment
2. Implementing caching for static elements
3. Optimizing image handling to reduce rendering time

## Implementation Details

1. **Existing Setup**: Continue using the existing Puppeteer configuration
2. **Template Enhancement**: Modify the existing HTML template to support new data fields and branding
3. **Resource Optimization**: Implement resource handling best practices for Puppeteer in Edge Functions

## Performance Considerations

To address performance concerns:
- Implement template precompilation
- Optimize image loading and processing
- Add monitoring for Puppeteer resource usage 
- Consider implementing a queue system for high-volume report generation
