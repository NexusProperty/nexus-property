"# Phase 4: Report Generation Enhancement - Remaining Tasks

## Image Optimization Implementation

### 1. Image Handling Enhancement
- [ ] Create an image optimization utility in the Edge Function
- [ ] Implement image caching for agency logos and property images
- [ ] Add automatic compression for large images
- [ ] Implement lazy loading strategy for report images

### 2. Image Cache Structure
```typescript
interface ImageCache {
  url: string;
  optimizedUrl?: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  format: string;
  size: number;
  optimizedSize?: number;
  lastAccessed: Date;
}
```

### 3. Implementation Approach
1. Check if image is already in cache
2. If not cached, fetch and optimize
3. Store optimized image in Supabase Storage
4. Return cached URL for report generation
5. Implement periodic cleanup of unused cached images

## Final Testing

### 1. PDF Generation Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with various image sizes and counts
- [ ] Measure report generation time before and after optimization
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks in the rendering process
- [ ] Document performance findings

### 2. Branding Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with different branding configurations
- [ ] Verify color scheme application across report elements
- [ ] Validate font consistency
- [ ] Test with various logo sizes and formats

### 3. Data Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify CoreLogic data display
- [ ] Test REINZ data integration
- [ ] Validate AI-generated content formatting
- [ ] Test with missing or incomplete data scenarios

## Documentation Updates

### 1. User Documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for branding configuration
- [ ] Document report customization options
- [ ] Provide image guidelines for optimal report quality

### 2. Developer Documentation
- [ ] Document the enhanced report generation architecture
- [ ] Create technical documentation for image optimization
- [ ] Update API documentation for the report generation endpoint
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common report generation issues

## Deployment Plan

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checks
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Conduct performance validation
- [ ] Ensure error handling is robust
- [ ] Check compatibility with various PDF viewers

### 2. Deployment Steps
- [ ] Deploy updated Edge Function
- [ ] Set up monitoring for report generation
- [ ] Configure alerts for errors or performance issues
- [ ] Implement gradual rollout strategy

### 3. Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Verify reports generate correctly in production
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Collect feedback from initial users
- [ ] Address any issues identified during initial rollout

## Transition to Phase 5

### 1. Frontend Requirements Documentation
- [ ] Document API changes for frontend team
- [ ] Create guidelines for branding UI implementation
- [ ] Define preview functionality requirements
- [ ] Specify image upload and management needs

### 2. Implementation Handover
- [ ] Conduct knowledge sharing session
- [ ] Prepare demo of enhanced reports
- [ ] Document integration points for frontend team
- [ ] Create test cases for frontend implementation"
