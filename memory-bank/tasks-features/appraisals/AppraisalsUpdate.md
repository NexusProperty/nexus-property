## Part 1: Plan to Implement New Data & Logic Changes for Enhanced Appraisal Reports

This plan outlines the development tasks to modify your existing "Nexus Property" / "AppraisalHub" backend and data structures to support the generation of the new, richly detailed, and branded appraisal reports.

**Pre-requisite:** Ensure CoreLogic API integration and REINZ API integration stubs/functions are in place as per previous plans, even if not fully live yet.

**Phase 1: Database Schema Modifications**

1.  **[ ] Review & Update `appraisals` Table:**
    *   **Add CoreLogic `propertyId`:** If not already present, add a field to store the canonical `propertyId` from CoreLogic.
    *   **Add Fields for AI-Generated Text:**
        *   `ai_market_overview TEXT`
        *   `ai_property_description TEXT`
        *   `ai_comparable_analysis_text TEXT`
        *   (Consider other AI text fields as needed, e.g., `ai_valuation_summary_text`)
    *   **Add Fields for Specific Data Points for Report:**
        *   `corelogic_avm_estimate NUMERIC`
        *   `corelogic_avm_range_low NUMERIC`
        *   `corelogic_avm_range_high NUMERIC`
        *   `corelogic_avm_confidence TEXT` (or a numeric score)
        *   `reinz_avm_estimate NUMERIC` (if distinct and fetched)
        *   `property_activity_summary JSONB` (to store CoreLogic's activity data)
        *   `market_statistics_corelogic JSONB`
        *   `market_statistics_reinz JSONB`
    *   **Refine `property_details` JSONB:** Ensure its structure can accommodate the diverse attributes from CoreLogic and any user overrides.
    *   **Refine `comparable_properties` JSONB:** Ensure it can store both REINZ and potentially CoreLogic comparables, clearly distinguishing their source and including necessary fields (photo URL, attributes, sale details).
2.  **[ ] Create/Update `Teams` (or `AgencyBranding`) Table:**
    *   Ensure fields exist for:
        *   `agency_logo_url TEXT`
        *   `agency_primary_color TEXT` (e.g., hex code)
        *   `agency_disclaimer_text TEXT`
        *   `agency_contact_details TEXT` (if different from individual agent)
    *   Link this table to agents/users.
3.  **[ ] Update `Profiles` Table (Agents):**
    *   Ensure fields for `agent_photo_url`, `agent_license_number`, and detailed contact info are robust.
4.  **[ ] Update Supabase TypeScript Types:** After schema changes, regenerate your Supabase types (`supabase gen types typescript ...`).

**Phase 2: Enhancing Data Ingestion (`data-ingestion-orchestrator` Edge Function - Task 3 of main plan)**

1.  **[ ] Implement Full CoreLogic Data Fetching:**
    *   Activate calls to all relevant CoreLogic endpoints identified previously (Attributes, Sales History, AVM, Images, Market Stats, Activity Summary, Title Details, Comparables, For Sale Nearby).
    *   Parse and standardize the responses.
    *   Store the fetched data into the new/updated fields in the `appraisals` record.
2.  **[ ] Implement Full REINZ Data Fetching:**
    *   Activate calls to REINZ API for comparables, market stats, and active listings.
    *   Parse and standardize responses.
    *   Store this data in the `appraisals` record, ensuring clear source attribution if storing alongside CoreLogic data.
3.  **[ ] Implement Data Consolidation Logic:**
    *   If fetching similar data from both CoreLogic and REINZ (e.g., comparables, market stats), decide on a strategy:
        *   Prioritize one source.
        *   Merge the data.
        *   Store both and let the report template decide what to display.
    *   Ensure all data is stored in the structure expected by the `property-valuation` function and the `generate-report` function.

**Phase 3: Enhancing Valuation Process (`property-valuation` Edge Function - Task 4 of main plan)**

1.  **[ ] Adapt Algorithmic Valuation Input:**
    *   Ensure your existing numerical valuation algorithm can consume the potentially richer/more diverse comparable data (from REINZ & CoreLogic).
2.  **[ ] Implement Enhanced Gemini AI Prompt Engineering:**
    *   Modify the prompt generation logic to include the newly available data points from CoreLogic and REINZ (e.g., both AVMs, detailed property activity, richer market stats).
    *   Refine prompts to instruct Gemini to generate text suitable for the specific sections of the new report design (market overview, property description, comparable analysis).
3.  **[ ] Store All AI Outputs:**
    *   Ensure the parsed text from Gemini is saved to the new `ai_..._text` fields in the `appraisals` table.

**Phase 4: Implementing Report Generation Logic (`generate-report` Edge Function - Task 5 of main plan)**

This task now becomes significantly more complex due to the advanced design and branding.

1.  **[ ] Select/Implement PDF Generation Strategy:**
    *   Finalize choice: Puppeteer/Playwright (recommended for design flexibility), pdfmake, etc.
    *   Set up the chosen library in your Edge Function environment.
2.  **[ ] Implement Branding Data Retrieval:**
    *   When the function is called, fetch the `agent_id` from the `appraisals` record.
    *   Query the `Profiles` and `Teams` (or `AgencyBranding`) tables to get the agent's photo, contact info, agency logo, brand color, and custom disclaimers.
    *   Have a fallback to default "AppraisalHub" branding if no agent is associated.
3.  **[ ] Implement Data Aggregation for Template:**
    *   Fetch the complete `appraisals` record, including all CoreLogic, REINZ, and AI-generated data.
    *   Transform/format this data into a structure that is easy for your chosen templating engine to consume.
4.  **[ ] Integrate with HTML/PDF Template (from Part 2 Plan):**
    *   Pass the aggregated data and branding information to your HTML templating engine (if using Puppeteer) or directly to the PDF library.
    *   If using HTML/Puppeteer:
        *   Write logic to dynamically set CSS variables or inline styles for branding (e.g., `document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--brand-color', agency_primary_color);`).
        *   Ensure images (logos, property photos, agent photos) are correctly referenced or embedded.
5.  **[ ] Implement PDF Generation, Storage, and Linking (as before, but with the new template).**

**Phase 5: Frontend Modifications (Agent Portal)**

1.  **[ ] Update Team Management/Profile Settings UI:**
    *   Allow agents/admins to upload agency logos.
    *   Allow input for agency primary brand color (e.g., color picker).
    *   Allow input for custom agency disclaimers.
    *   Ensure agent profile photos can be managed.
    *   Store this branding data via backend endpoints to the `Teams`/`Profiles` tables.

**Phase 6: Testing**

1.  **[ ] Test Data Ingestion:** Verify all data from CoreLogic and REINZ is fetched and stored correctly.
2.  **[ ] Test AI Integration:** Verify prompts are correct and AI text is generated and stored.
3.  **[ ] Test Report Generation:**
    *   Verify PDFs are generated with the correct data.
    *   Verify agent/agency branding (logo, color, disclaimers) is applied correctly.
    *   Test with different agents/agencies to ensure branding changes.
    *   Test default branding for customer-only reports.
    *   Verify layout and design match the intended template (from Part 2 Plan).
    *   Check PDF for rendering issues, image quality, font embedding.

## Part 2: Plan for the Design of the Appraisal Report Template (PDF)

This plan focuses on the creative and technical design process for the PDF report template itself. This is best done by a UI/UX designer or a developer with strong frontend/design skills, possibly in collaboration.

**Phase 1: Research & Inspiration (Already Partially Done)**

1.  **[ ] Analyze Provided Examples:**
    *   Thoroughly review the Bayleys PDF and the PropertySmarts screenshots.
    *   Identify key sections, information hierarchy, visual styles, typography, and use of imagery for each.
2.  **[ ] Collect Other High-Quality Real Estate Report Examples:**
    *   Look for other professional market appraisals or property reports for further inspiration on layout, data visualization, and design best practices.

**Phase 2: Information Architecture & Wireframing**

1.  **[ ] Define Report Sections & Content Inventory:**
    *   Based on the "Target Design & Information Structure" from our previous discussion and the data you'll now have (CoreLogic, REINZ, AI), create a definitive list of all sections for the *AppraisalHub* report.
    *   For each section, list the specific data points and content types (text, tables, images, charts, AI commentary) that will be included.
    *   Decide on the flow and order of these sections.
    *   Consider variations for a "Limited Customer Report" vs. a "Full Agent Report."
2.  **[ ] Create Low-Fidelity Wireframes:**
    *   For each page/section of the report, sketch out simple wireframes (digital or paper).
    *   Focus on layout, placement of key elements (logo, property photo, headings, data blocks, charts, comparables), and overall structure.
    *   Don't worry about colors or specific fonts at this stage.
    *   Create wireframes for how agent branding elements will be incorporated (e.g., where does the logo go, how is the brand color used).
    *   Iterate on wireframes based on clarity and information flow.

**Phase 3: Visual Design & Mockups (High-Fidelity)**

1.  **[ ] Establish Visual Style Guide (or adapt agency's if possible):**
    *   **Typography:** Choose primary and secondary fonts for headings, body text, captions. Ensure readability.
    *   **Color Palette:** Define a base palette for the AppraisalHub report. This will be *overridden/accented* by the agent's/agency's primary brand color. Define how the brand color will be used (e.g., headings, highlights, borders).
    *   **Iconography:** Select or design simple icons if needed (e.g., for bedrooms, bathrooms).
    *   **Imagery Style:** Guidelines for property photos, map styles, chart styles.
2.  **[ ] Create High-Fidelity Mockups:**
    *   Using a design tool (Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch), create detailed visual mockups of key report pages based on the wireframes and style guide.
    *   Showcase how real data (or realistic placeholder data) would look.
    *   Illustrate the application of agent/agency branding (logo, brand color, agent photo).
    *   Design tables, charts, and other data visualizations for clarity and aesthetic appeal.
    *   Pay attention to spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy.
    *   Design for both A4/Letter PDF output.
    *   Get feedback on mockups from stakeholders. Iterate as needed.

**Phase 4: HTML/CSS Template Development (If using Puppeteer/Playwright)**

This is where the visual design is translated into a web-based template.

1.  **[ ] Develop Semantic HTML Structure:**
    *   Create the HTML structure for each section of the report based on the approved mockups. Use semantic HTML5 tags.
    *   Use a templating language (Handlebars, EJS, Nunjucks, or even JSX if doing SSR with React/Vue) for dynamic data insertion. Define clear placeholders for all data points and branding elements.
2.  **[ ] Implement CSS Styling:**
    *   Write CSS to match the visual design from the mockups.
    *   Use a responsive approach if the HTML template might also be viewed directly in a browser (though primary target is PDF).
    *   Implement CSS variables for the agent's/agency's primary brand color and potentially other themeable elements.
    *   Style tables, lists, headings, paragraphs, images, and any custom components.
    *   Consider print-specific CSS (`@media print`) if there are differences needed for PDF output vs. screen.
3.  **[ ] Implement Charting Libraries (if generating charts dynamically):**
    *   If you need to generate charts (e.g., market trends) dynamically within the HTML based on data, integrate a JavaScript charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js – though D3 might be overkill for static PDF reports).
    *   Alternatively, CoreLogic might provide image URLs for charts which can be directly embedded.
4.  **[ ] Test HTML Template with Sample Data:**
    *   Manually populate the HTML template with sample data (including branding elements) to ensure it renders correctly in a browser.
    *   Test how the agent's brand color dynamically changes the appearance.

**Phase 5: PDF-Specific Considerations & Refinement**

1.  **[ ] Page Breaks & Pagination:**
    *   Consider how content will flow across pages. Use CSS properties like `page-break-before`, `page-break-after`, `page-break-inside` to control breaks and avoid awkward splits.
2.  **[ ] Headers & Footers:**
    *   Design and implement consistent headers/footers for the PDF (e.g., report title, page numbers, agency name, date generated). Puppeteer/Playwright have options for this.
3.  **[ ] Font Embedding:**
    *   Ensure that the fonts used in your HTML/CSS template are either web-safe or can be correctly embedded into the PDF by the generation library to maintain visual consistency.
4.  **[ ] Image Optimization & Resolution:**
    *   Ensure images are appropriately sized and optimized for PDF inclusion to balance quality and file size.
5.  **[ ] Test PDF Output Extensively:**
    *   Generate PDFs using your chosen library (e.g., Puppeteer) from the HTML template.
    *   Review for layout issues, font rendering, image quality, page breaks, and overall fidelity to the design mockups.
    *   Test with various data lengths to see how the layout adapts.

**Key Personnel for Template Design:**

*   **UI/UX Designer:** For wireframing, visual design, mockups, and style guide.
*   **Frontend Developer (with strong HTML/CSS):** For developing the HTML/CSS template, especially if using a browser-rendering engine like Puppeteer.

This two-part plan should provide a clear roadmap for both the backend changes and the intricate design work required for your new appraisal reports. Good luck!
