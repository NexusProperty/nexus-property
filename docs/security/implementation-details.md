# Security Implementation Documentation

This document outlines the security implementations in the Nexus Property application, covering authentication, authorization, data protection, and other security-related features.

## Authentication

### Supabase Auth Integration

The application uses Supabase Auth, which is built on top of GoTrue, providing:

- Email/password authentication
- Password reset functionality
- JWT-based session management
- Session refresh capabilities

Key authentication files:
- `src/services/auth.ts` - Authentication service functions
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - React context for auth state
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up**:
   - User submits registration form
   - Input is validated using Zod schemas
   - User account is created in Supabase Auth
   - User profile is created in `profiles` table
   - Success/error response is returned

2. **Sign In**:
   - User submits login form
   - Credentials are validated using Zod schemas
   - Authentication request is sent to Supabase Auth
   - JWT token is returned and stored in memory
   - User and profile data are fetched
   - Auth context is updated

3. **Password Reset**:
   - User requests password reset
   - Reset email is sent through Supabase Auth
   - User receives email with reset link
   - User sets new password
   - Password is updated in Supabase Auth

### Token Management

- JWT tokens are stored securely through Supabase's built-in storage
- Tokens are refreshed automatically by Supabase Auth client
- No sensitive token information is stored in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Token validation occurs on both client and server

## Authorization

### Row Level Security (RLS)

Supabase Row Level Security policies restrict access to database records:

- Each table has specific RLS policies
- Policies ensure users can only access their own data
- Admin users have elevated permissions through role-based policies
- Policies are implemented directly in the database layer

Example RLS policy:

```sql
-- Allow users to read their own properties
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own properties" 
ON properties FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to update their own properties
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own properties" 
ON properties FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Role-Based Access Control

The application implements role-based access control:

- User roles: `customer`, `agent`, `admin`
- Roles are stored in user metadata
- UI elements are conditionally rendered based on roles
- Edge functions enforce role-based access
- Database policies respect user roles

## API Security

### Edge Function Authentication

Edge functions are protected by the authentication middleware:

- `withAuth` middleware in `supabase/functions/utils/auth-middleware.ts`
- JWT verification occurs for every protected endpoint
- Role-based restrictions can be applied to specific endpoints
- Consistent error responses for authentication failures

Example edge function protection:

```typescript
// Protect an edge function with authentication
export const handler = withAuth(async (req) => {
  // Only authenticated users can access this function
  const { userId } = getAuthUser(req);
  
  // Function implementation...
}, { requireAuth: true });

// Restrict to specific roles
export const adminHandler = withAuth(async (req) => {
  // Only admins can access this function
  // Function implementation...
}, { 
  requireAuth: true, 
  allowedRoles: ['admin']
});
```

### CSRF Protection

The application implements Cross-Site Request Forgery protection:

- Custom CSRF token generation in `src/lib/csrf.ts`
- Tokens are included in all API requests
- Token validation on the server side
- Token refresh mechanism
- Integration with Supabase API calls

## Data Protection

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated:

- Zod schemas define validation rules
- Frontend form validation with react-hook-form
- Backend validation in services and edge functions
- Validation errors are returned in a consistent format

### Sensitive Information Handling

- Passwords are never stored in the application code
- Database credentials are stored in environment variables
- API keys are never exposed in the client code
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- Logging respects privacy by not recording sensitive data

### Environment Variable Management

- `.env` files for local development
- Environment variables in production environment
- Strict validation of required environment variables
- Type safety with environment variable schema

## Secure Networking

### HTTPS

- All production traffic uses HTTPS
- HTTPS redirection is enforced
- Secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Content Security Policy implemented

### Rate Limiting

- API rate limiting implemented through Supabase
- Configurable limits by endpoint
- Proper response codes (429) for rate-limiting
- Exponential backoff for retries

## Security Monitoring

### Error Logging

- Structured logging format
- Error categorization
- Security-related events are specifically logged
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is not logged

### Audit Trail

- Key user actions are logged in the database
- Timestamps and user IDs for all significant operations
- Non-repudiation of user actions
- Audit logs are protected by RLS

## Development Practices

### Code Reviews

- Security-focused code reviews
- Authentication/authorization changes require additional review
- Database schema changes are carefully reviewed

### Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Minimal use of external dependencies
- Lock files committed to repository

## Security Testing

### Manual Testing

- Authentication flow testing
- Authorization testing
- Edge case testing for security functionality

### Automated Testing

- Unit tests for security-critical functions
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- API tests with authentication scenarios

## Future Security Improvements

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**:
   - Add support for 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS

2. **Enhanced Password Policies**:
   - Implement stronger password requirements
   - Detect and prevent password reuse

3. **Session Management**:
   - Add explicit user session listing and management
   - Allow users to terminate sessions remotely

4. **Rate Limiting Enhancements**:
   - More granular rate limiting by user and endpoint
   - Adaptive rate limiting based on behavior patterns

5. **Security Headers**:
   - Implement additional HTTP security headers
   - Regular security header audits
