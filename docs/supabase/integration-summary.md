# Supabase Integration Summary

This document provides a summary of the Supabase integration for the AppraisalHub application.

## Connection Details

The application has been successfully connected to the following Supabase project:

- **Project URL**: https://anrpboahhkahdprohtln.supabase.co
- **Project Reference ID**: anrpboahhkahdprohtln
- **Region**: ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)

## Configuration Files

The following configuration files have been set up:

1. **Supabase Client Configuration** (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)
   - Initialized with project URL and anonymous key
   - Includes admin client with service role key for Edge Functions

2. **Database Schema** (`scripts/init-schema.sql`)
   - Complete SQL schema definition for the application
   - Includes tables, relationships, triggers, and RLS policies

3. **Edge Functions** (`supabase/functions/*`)
   - Property Data
   - Property Valuation
   - AI Market Analysis

## Implementation Steps Completed

1. **Client-Side Connection**
   - Updated Supabase client configuration
   - Created test scripts to verify connection
   - Implemented both anonymous and service role clients

2. **Database Setup**
   - Created SQL schema definition
   - Documented deployment options
   - Set up basic RLS policies for data security

3. **Edge Functions**
   - Set up environment variables
   - Documentation for deploying functions
   - Testing procedures

## Next Steps

1. **Database Schema Deployment**
   - Execute the SQL schema on the Supabase project
   - Verify tables and relationships
   - Test RLS policies

2. **Edge Functions Deployment**
   - Install Docker Desktop
   - Deploy the Edge Functions to Supabase
   - Test the functions with sample data

3. **Authentication Setup**
   - Configure authentication providers
   - Set up email templates
   - Test authentication flow

4. **Storage Buckets**
   - Create buckets for property images and reports
   - Configure bucket policies
   - Test file uploads and downloads

## Testing

Testing scripts have been created to verify the Supabase connection:

1. `scripts/test-supabase-connection.js` - Tests the anonymous client connection
2. `scripts/test-supabase-service-role.js` - Tests the service role client connection

Both tests have been executed and confirmed working.

## Documentation

The following documentation files have been created:

1. `supabase-connection.md` - Details of the Supabase connection setup
2. `database-setup.md` - Instructions for setting up the database schema
3. `edge-functions-setup.md` - Instructions for deploying the Edge Functions

## Security Considerations

1. The service role key has been properly secured and documented
2. RLS policies have been implemented for data security
3. JWT tokens are required for Edge Function authentication
