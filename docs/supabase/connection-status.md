# Supabase Connection Status

## Connection Verification

We've confirmed that the basic Supabase connection is working:

- ✅ **Authentication Service**: Successfully connects to the Supabase auth service
- ✅ **REST API Access**: The REST API endpoints are accessible (returns Unauthorized as expected without proper headers)
- ❌ **Database Schema**: There's an issue with the database schema migrations

## Current Issues

1. **Migration Error**: The database migrations are failing with the error:
   ```
   ERROR: column "team_id" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42703)
   ```

2. **Schema Mismatch**: The initial schema migration created the appraisals table without a team_id column, but later migrations try to create an index on this non-existent column.

## Solutions

1. **Fix Database Schema**: 
   - We've created a repair script at `scripts/create-tables.sql` that will fix the column and index issues
   - This should be executed through the Supabase Dashboard's SQL Editor

2. **Update Supabase Client**:
   - We've improved the Supabase client configuration in `src/lib/supabase.ts` with better error handling and connection options
   - Added a connection checking function to verify connectivity

3. **Simplified Connection Testing**:
   - Created `scripts/check-connection.js` that confirms basic connectivity to Supabase services
   - This test is passing, confirming that our credentials and basic connection are working

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Fixes**:
   - Use the Supabase Dashboard to run the repair script from `scripts/create-tables.sql`
   - This will add the missing columns and create the appropriate indexes

2. **Deploy Edge Functions**:
   - After fixing the database schema, proceed with deploying the Edge Functions
   - Follow the instructions in `edge-functions-setup.md`

3. **Create Storage Buckets**:
   - Set up storage buckets for property images and reports
   - Configure appropriate access policies

## Conclusion

The Supabase connection itself is working correctly, but there are issues with the database schema that need to be fixed before the application can fully function. The repair script should resolve these issues without requiring a complete database reset.
